%\section{Concepts and Literature Review}
\label{sec:cap2}

According to \textcite{Aguiar2025_SEE_Space_to_Accelerator}, the continuous expansion of human activity into extreme environments, such as outer space and experimental physics accelerators, has intensified the need to understand and mitigate radiation effects on electronic components. In addition, the growing use of nanosatellites~\cite{Balbino2022,Rao2023} and the emergence of the New Space paradigm~\cite{9298818} have opened discussions on the adoption of cheaper, faster, and more easily procurable components and systems for deployment in harsh environments.

Recent studies, such as those presented by \textcite{Aguiar2025_SEE_Space_to_Accelerator}, emphasize that radiation induced phenomena, such as \gls{see}, pose a major challenge to the reliability of modern electronics. Consequently, significant research has focused on analyzing \gls{see}-related failure mechanisms and developing design-level mitigation strategies to improve system resilience under harsh operating conditions.
